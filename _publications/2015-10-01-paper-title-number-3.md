#### * Multicriteria reinforcement learning (Betreuer: Xudong Sun)
A classical reinforcement learning agent tries to optimize a value function and adapt its behavior with policy iteration and balance the exploitation and exploration trade off with a probability sampling. However, it would be smarter to optimize several objective functions simultaneously. In this project, you will learn how to do bayesian optimization in a multi-criteria sense in the application scenario of reinforcement learning.

#### * Semantic web for machine learning and Conditional Random Field for code completion (Betreuer: Xudong Sun)
A knowledge graph in the form of semantic web will be created to help the user buid a machine learning pipeline which will also utilize CRF models for automatic code completion. See [Big code](http://learnbigcode.github.io/challenges/). You will build a model to predict what will be the next line of code.
