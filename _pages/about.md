I am interested in Domain Generalization, Causality, Digital Communication, Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning, Knowledge graph, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. I used to have a sound knowledge of Abstract Algebra. Some fair knowledge about Biology and Physics.

Some research project I have done:

- Open source software development for Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning
- Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization and decentralized Machine Learning
- Deep Reinforcement Learning, Functional Data (time series) regression and classification and Recurrent Neural Network
- Probablistic Graphical Model and Generative Neural Network
- Recommendation Systems and Semantic Web
- Applications of Machine Learning in Bio-chemical and Bio-medical fields
